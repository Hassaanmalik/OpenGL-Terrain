Assignment 1

Run the make file by typing make

Once the program is open press any key to show a normal grid with lighting enabled

Press V to enable the circle algorithm and use the arrow keys to control the camera

Use the control instructions to enable and disable features

For the extra features I have done the Fault algorithm and improved map colouring

For the coloruing I have made it groovy by chaning the colour to make it look like earth, press e to enable that and disable that

Have fun playing around with this program. I really enjoyed making it.
